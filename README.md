## ✍️ Project Description  
StrategiXAgent is an AI-powered assistant designed to help commercial teams monitor and analyze the competitive landscape within specific therapeutic areas. Our goal is to collect structured and unstructured data from sources like ClinicalTrials.gov, company press releases, and pharmaceutical pipeline trackers. Using APIs such as the OpenAI API, the tool extracts details like trial phases, mechanisms of action, and sponsor names, and generates concise, actionable summaries for the team.
